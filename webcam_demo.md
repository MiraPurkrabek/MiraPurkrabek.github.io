<div style="text-align: justify;">
Some people were asking me how was my CVPR live webcam demo done.
Even though it is not a rocket science, I share here how I did it such that people can make their own demos.
The how-to will be most suitable for people from VRG as they can use the same computational resources as I did but it might come handy to anyone.

### What is the result and why should I care?

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The goal is to make live webcamera demo that is running on a portable device and could be integrated to the poster.
On CVPR 2025, I used my iPad, stuck it to the poster and the demo ran for more than 2 hours during the poster session.
Below you can see how did it look like.

Why should you care?
So great, you did a nice research, got accepted to major conference and now you can show your work to other experts in the field.
BUT!
On main CV (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ...) conferences, there are approx. 2 hours for ~500 posters.
If you would read them all, you would have 14 seconds per poster.
So you need to grab attention and interactive demo is (according to me) the best way.
Apart from that, demo is a simple and super effective way to communicate your work without exhausting the audience.
I'm not a text guy so I would rather see 500 live demos than 500 posters.

So now you are convinced that you want to make an impressive demo on your poster.
Below I'm sharing what I did for my CVPR demo, what did not work and what options I did not explored.
It is not supposed to be "the best way" but sharing my experience such that more people would make demos.
