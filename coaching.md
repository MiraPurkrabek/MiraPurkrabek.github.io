I’m a floorball coach currently leading the men’s team of Sokol Královské Vinohrady (SKV) in the Czech highest league — Superliga.
I’ve been part of the club since 2017 and became head coach in 2024 at the age of 27, making me one of the youngest head coaches in Superliga history.
So far, I’ve coached over 200 matches, including more than 100 in the Superliga.
Over the years, we’ve achieved the best results in SKV’s history by building a team based on clear roles, dedication, and team spirit.

### Leadng the Men’s Team

**2022 - today**

In 2022, I took over the SKV men’s team alongside Jan Kapucián.
While Jan handled management and off-court matters, I was mainly in charge of the floorball side.
We built a team from mostly young players and tried to play simple, hard-working floorball.

In our first season together (2022/23), we finished 10th and made it through the pre-quarterfinal to reach the Superliga quarterfinals.
In 2023/24, we made the playoffs again from the 10th place.
In 2024, I officially became the head coach.
That season, we finished 9th after regular season and in playoffs reached the top 8 again.

I’m proud we’ve managed to make SKV a regular playoff team — even without big names or a big budget.

### The Juniors

**2019 - 2022**

In between my roles with the men’s team, I coached the U19 team.
I focused a lot on preparing players for senior floorball - not just technically, but mentally too.
Much of that time was affected by Covid shutdowns, so we ran individual physical training and I mentored players online to help them stay connected to the sport.
After Covid, in the 2021/22 season, we qualified for the top junior league and made the playoffs in our very first year there.

Some of the guys I coached are now part of our Superliga team.
That’s the most satisfying part of the job.

### Beginnings in SKV

**2017 – 2020**

I joined SKV in 2017 as an assistant coach for the men’s team.
Before that, I coached kids in a local club - this was my first experience at the highest level.
I was 20, new to the club, and honestly not sure if I was ready.
Over time, I gained more responsibility, experience, and confidence.

In my first season, we played in 1. liga (the second-highest league).
We ended up winning it and earned promotion to the Superliga.
In 2019, we managed to stay in the league by winning the first round of playdowns.

After that second season, Michal Kotlas and David Bouša took over the team, and I stayed on as their assistant.
That year, we finished 8th after the regular season and made it to the playoffs, for the first time in SKV’s history.
Unfortunately, we didn’t get to play them, as the season was cancelled due to Covid.

### More than Coaching

During my Erasmus stay in Ljubljana, I coached FBK Olimpija for a few months and refereed some league matches.
I also hold a Czech coaching B license and used to referee women’s and youth games in Prague.

Outside the field, I study computer vision and AI at CTU.
I use sport as a case study in my research and have shared some of it at coaching seminars.

### If you’d like to know more…

We talked about some of this in a podcast for SKV (in Czech).
It covers coaching, my view on floorball and SKV and we even touched how AI and computer vision could impact the game.
