I am a PhD student at the <a href='https://vrg.fel.cvut.cz/'>Visual Recognition Group (VRG)</a> at <a href='https://fel.cvut.cz/en'>FEE, Czech Technical University in Prague</a>, advised by <a href="https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~matas/">prof. Ing. Jiří Matas Ph.D.</a>. My research interest lies in the application of machine learning to visual recognition tasks. I am currently working on player identification and tracking in sports videos. 

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.

### Education

YOLO!
